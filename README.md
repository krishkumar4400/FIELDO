# FIELDO

> AI-powered dispatch intelligence platform for HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and field service businesses.

FIELDO helps service companies automatically assign the right technician to the right job using operational intelligence, realtime routing, AI predictions, and workflow automation.

Instead of relying on:

* phone calls
* dispatcher intuition
* WhatsApp chaos
* spreadsheets
* whiteboards

FIELDO creates an intelligent operational layer for field workforce coordination.

---

# Vision

Field service industries still operate with fragmented systems and manual coordination.

FIELDO aims to become:

> The operating system for field operations.

Our mission is to reduce:

* wrong technician dispatches
* excessive drive time
* callbacks
* scheduling chaos
* dispatcher overload
* operational inefficiency

using AI-powered decision systems.

---

# Problem

Most HVAC, plumbing, and electrical companies still rely on:

* dispatch managers
* manual scheduling
* spreadsheets
* WhatsApp groups
* paper job cards
* phone calls

This creates:

* delayed assignments
* poor technician utilization
* customer frustration
* repeat visits
* fuel waste
* operational stress

A 20-technician service company can lose:

* ₹20L–₹50L yearly
  from inefficient dispatching alone.

---

# Solution

FIELDO automatically:

* recommends the best technician
* optimizes routes
* predicts job duration
* estimates callback risk
* balances technician workload
* tracks field operations in realtime

The platform combines:

* operational workflows
* location intelligence
* predictive AI
* workforce analytics
* dispatch automation

into a single command center.
